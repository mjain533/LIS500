  <!-- 1. Implicit Bias -->
  <div class="section-card">
    <h2>Implicit Bias</h2>
    <p>
Implicit bias is about the automatic assumptions and stereotypes we all carry, often without even realizing it. These biases shape how we see others, how we react, and even how we participate in systems of power. We can see that bias isn’t always about overt actions but about the subtle ways we distance ourselves, check out, or rely on people of color to educate us. When we think about our own learning, it’s important to recognize that we don’t have to be aware of bias for it to exist. Protecting our worldview instead of questioning it can keep these patterns in place. In our group, this connects directly to the themes we discuss about power and digital life. Just like technology can reinforce existing inequalities, our implicit biases reinforce social systems if we don’t work to notice and challenge them. By practicing humility, paying attention to how our assumptions surface, and being open to feedback, we begin to disrupt these patterns instead of unconsciously maintaining them.

  <!-- 2. Implicit Bias Test (IBT) -->
  <div class="section-card">
    <h2>Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</h2>
    <p>
 In regards to the Implicit Bias Test, it was very interesting how there were many different topics but the same principles were still conveyed. We found it interesting how regardless of the specific test, there was more of a challenge matching and remembering certain letters on the keyboard to an image or word rather than the meaning of the word/image itself. This can be seen as a little bit of a challenge when determining the true level of bias throughout one of these tests. However, the speed factor caused some minor errors to be made when trying to match the words, leading to inaccuracy.

  <!-- 3. Intersectionality -->
  <div class="section-card">
    <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
    <p>
Intersectionality is about recognizing that our experiences and identities are shaped by more than just one single factor. Instead of focusing only on race or gender or class, we think about how these different parts of who we are overlap and interact to influence our lives. This perspective helps us understand that inequality, representation, and access are complex and have multiple layers. By looking through an intersectional lens, we gain better tools for analyzing who benefits, who gets excluded, and how power operates in the world around us.
